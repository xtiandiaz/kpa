# Kids Puzzle Adventure

Originally written from scratch, in vanilla JS, back in 2014, and posted for sale on [Codecanyon](https://codecanyon.net/).

The game grabs a collection of thematized stamps to be sticked on a frame after completing their puzzles. The puzzles are automatically generated jigsaw puzzles made from any provided square images broken into polygonal pieces using a tesselation algorithm. 

This project is no longer maintained or revisited, except that I'm translating part of the code into pure TypeScript, formalizing the core logic into an elemental 'game engine' ([Emerald-Pixi](https://github.com/xtiandiaz/emerald-pixi)), and using it as source and inspiration for an alternative puzzle game (also for kids).
